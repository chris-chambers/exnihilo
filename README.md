# Ex Nihilo

If you had a blank computer, could you ever do anything with it? Say you were
on a desert island with only a source of electricity, a computer with a blank
hard drive, and luckily, a copy of the Intel X86 Instruction Set Architecture
manual, could you bootstrap a useful system?

## Progress
