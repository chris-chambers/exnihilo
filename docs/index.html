  <h1>Ex Nihilo</h1>
  <p>
    If you had a blank computer, could you ever do anything with it? Say you
    were on a desert island with only a source of electricity, a computer
    with a blank hard drive, and luckily, a copy of the Intel X86 Instruction
    Set Architecture manual, could you bootstrap a useful system?
  </p>
  <h2>Rules</h2>
  <p>
    For practical reasons, this project cheats a little. First, all the work
    is done in a VirtualBox VM rather than a physical machine. Second, the
    initial disk image (containing just the monitor program that follows) is
    created outside of VirtualBox, using <code>xxd</code>and
    <code>VBoxManage</code>. And finally, I haven't strictly limited the
    resources I'm willing to use. Notably,
    <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org">OSDev Wiki</a> and
    <a href="https://forth-standard.org/">FORTH Standard</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the future, I may try to use a real device, emulate an IDE or SATA
    device "by hand" for the initial monitor program, and limit the reference
    material to only instruction set reference (or perhaps no reference at all).
    But not yet.
  </p>

<section id="monitor">
  <h1>Monitor</h1>
  <p>
    First, we need a way to get any data at all into memory, so it can be
    executed. A monitor program is placed in the boot sector so that is executes
    on boot.  We'll skip hand-emulated SATA for now.
  </p>
  <img class="subject" src="img/halves/01-0.jpg">
  <p>
    This monitor accepts hex input from the keyboard and writes it to the
    location given by <code>[di]</code>. Absolutely no error handling is
    done, so it is critical to type without mistakes. It's important for this
    initial program to be as small and simple as possible, since in a real
    desert island computer emergency, it would need to be inputted by
    emulating a disk drive. This won't take long to explain, since there
    isn't much of it.
  </p>
  <p>
    First, it sets the segment registers <code>cs</code>, <code>ds</code>, and
    <code>es</code> to zero (<code>es</code> turned out to be unnecessary).
  </p>
  <p>
    Then, it processes characters from the keyboard one by one using BIOS
    interrupt <code>16h</code> to read a character, then interrupt
    <code>10h</code> to echo it.  Each character is first checked to see if it
    is a command character.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the character is a <code>.</code>, the last two bytes are interpreted
    as an address, and the write pointer is set to that address:
  </p>
  <pre><code
>mov di, [di - 2]
</code></pre>
  <p>
    If the character is <code>!</code>, the last two bytes are interpreted as
    an address, and that address is called.
  </p>
  <pre><code
>dec di; dec di
call [di]
</code></pre>
  <p>
    An earlier version used <code>jmp</code> rather than <code>call</code>,
    but calling is much more useful since it allows multiple functions to be
    called, each time returning to the monitor for further data entry or
    function calling. Callees must save the registers they modify!
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <img class="subject" src="img/halves/01-1.jpg">
  <p>
    If the current character is not a command character, then it is interpreted
    as a nibble in a byte that will be written to <code>[di]</code>.  Within
    <code>loop_outer</code>, <code>cx</code> is set to <code>2</code>, since
    there are two hex characters in a byte.  <code>dl</code> is used as an
    accumulator for the byte value.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since <code>0-9</code> and <code>a-f</code> are not adjacent in ASCII, and
    we would like to write as little hand-assembled machine code as possible,
    the math to convert a character into a nibble value looks a little strange:
  </p>
  <p>
    First, <code>dl</code> is shifted left by <code>4</code> to move the last
    nibble up and out of the way of the nibble being read now. Then, the
    value of <code>:</code> is subtracted. Since <code>:</code> immediately
    follows <code>9</code>, after the subtraction the value is negative if
    it is in <code>0-9</code>, and non-negative if it is in <code>a-f</code>.
    No attempt is made to handle invalid characters.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the character is <code>0-9</code>, <code>10</code> is added to bring it
    back above zero, and it is added
  </p>
  <p>
    If the character is <code>a-f</code>, then the value has
    <code>('a' - ':')</code> subtracted from it, to bring it to
    <code>0-5</code>. Execution then falls through to the digit handling, where
    <code>10</code> is added and accumulation occurs.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the second loop in <code>loop_inner</code>, <code>stosb</code> is used to
    store the accumulated byte value to <code>[di]</code> and increment
    <code>di</code>.  Then a space is emitted using interrupt <code>10h</code>,
    to make it easier to see what has been typed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, a short test is provided.  It moves <code>di</code> to
    <code>0x8000</code>, inputs a short function that prints <code>~</code>, and
    then calls that function.
  </p>

  <h1>Persistence</h1>
  <p>
    Now that we can enter functions and call them, the most critical thing is to
    be able to save our work.  Since the monitor does no input validation, and
    we are assembling instructions by hand, mistakes will be common.  We don't
    want to start from scratch every time we hang the machine (which will be
    often).
  </p>
  <p>
    BIOS interrupt <code>13h</code> is used to read and write using LBA.  Two
    configuration structures are built:  one that writes the boot sector, and
    another to read and write 63 sectors at <code>0x8000</code>.  "Why 63?" you
    ask.  Because 64 caused a hang.  I didn't bother to diagnose why, but
    possibly because <code>0x8000 + 64 * 512</code> is too large to fit in a
    16-bit integer.
  </p>
  <p>
    One important thing to note is that these functions are all defined in the
    memory occupied by the boot sector.  It is dangerous to rewrite the boot
    sector, but it's important for these persistence functions. We need them to
    be available at boot so they can be used to load everything else.

  <h1>FORTH</h1>
  <p>
    Writing out assembly by hand, translating it to hex, and keying it without
    mistakes is tedious and awful.  So, as soon as possible, it would be nice to
    work at a higher level of abstraction.  FORTH is a good candidate for
    several reasons:  it's easy to parse, straighforward to bridge with native
    code, and—crucially—suitable for bootstrapping itself.
